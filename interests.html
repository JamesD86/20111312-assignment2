            <strong>Music</strong>
            <p>I have been a music fan all my life. I play the drums, although it has been a long time. I have always been a bit of a metal head. The last concert I attended was before the COVID-19 pandemic, and it was to see Metallica at Slane Castle in 2019. My musical tastes are more varied than metal however. There is some hip-hop I like (a lot I loathe), and I also enjoy some classical music. I have not been much of a pop music fan. I probably couldn't name a Taylor Swift song, for example, but I have been a big fan of Lana del Rey since I first heard her in 2012, so I'm a music snob by any stretch. If it's good, it's good.</p>

            <strong>Movies</strong>
            <p>I have spent quite a share of my life watching movies. I have always loved them. The first movie I ever watched in a movie theater was Jurassic Park. It both terrified and thrilled me, but then again I was a little boy at the time. The original Independence Day had a similar effect on me. However, there are some films that are just untouchable. The Lord of the Rings trilogy is the greatest fantasy series, and greatest trilogy of all time (sorry, Star Wars!). The greatest movie, however, either belongs to the Godfather Part 2, or The Shawshank Redemption.</p>
			
			<b>Here's a top ten (subject to change based on the day!</b>
			
			<ol>
				<li>The Godfather Part II</li>
				<li>The Shawshank Redemption</li>
				<li>Lord of the Rings Trilogy

            <strong>Sport</strong>
            <p>My favorite sport is football. I used to play as a child but it has been a very long time since I kicked a football. I am a Manchester United fan (it has been a difficult decade) and old enough that I enjoyed witnessing unprecedented success under Sir Alex Ferguson. I still love football, though I do find that the Premier League has lost the fire it used to have. I occasionally watch Rugby when Ireland are playing, and watch Tipperary in the hurling. For combat sports, I used to watch boxing every weekend but it is not in a good state anymore, and definitely not worth staying up very late to watch.</p>

            <strong>Reading and Audiobooks</strong>
            <p>I've been an occasional reader all my life. I tend to enjoy science fiction books, such as Andy Weir's recent Project Hail Mary, which is being made into a film starring Ryan Gosling. I prefer audiobooks now to reading, as I can do that while walking and hiking. A few months ago, I started the Harry Potter series of books, having avoided them (and the movies) for a couple of decades. My favorite book, however, is probably George Orwell's 1984. Besides books,I tend to read a lot of news daily on my phone, which is a habit I have due to my past employment requiring a lot of reading.</p>
