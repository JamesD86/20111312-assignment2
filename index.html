            <strong>An Important Message!</strong>
            <p>I am Maisie and James is my pet human! I just wanted to paws for a minute to welcome you to sit....stay... right here. I've been watching patiently as James builds this website, when he could just as easily have been walking me! It's barking mad! My belly has remained thoroughly unrubbed for hours, and I have not been kept up to date on my status as "the best" either. It's a ruff life and I really hope it is worth the sacrifice.</p>
			
			<p>He better have left a dropbox for treats on our contact page!</p>
