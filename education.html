		<p class="bgwhite">I left school in my final year in 2004. It seemed like a great idea at the time, and it was only re-enforced by my recruitment at AfterDawn.com. Fast-forward seventeen years and I found myself out of work and with a serious deficit in my academic achievements. I decided to return to education and see what I could achieve.</p>

			<strong>VTOS (2021 - 2023)</strong>
			<p>In September 2021, I joined up with VTOS in Clonmel. The programme included three Leaving Certificate subjects (Biology, Mathematics, English) and a whole host of QQI Level 4 Modules. I decided to take on all three Leaving Certificate subjects at the Higher Level. To convince the VTOS Coordinator, Tony Kearins, and my teachers that I could do the Higher Level mathematics, I first took the Ordinary Level as a test in the 2022 Leaving Certificate, and was awarded an O1. In 2023, I took the three subjects at the Higher Level. My full results from VTOS are below! </p>

            <strong>Engineering Technology Level 5 (2023 - 2024)</strong>
            <p>At the end of my VTOS course, I was invited to apply for the Engineering Technology PLC course at the <a href="https://www.cti-clonmel.ie" target="_blank">Central Technical Institute (CTI)</a> in Clonmel. The CTI had also managed the VTOS programme, and so I was accepted immediately. The course involved hands-on practical instructions, such as Furniture Design, Engineering Workshop Processes, and Electronics. There was also modules for Computer Aided Draughting (CAD), Mathematics Level 5, Health & Safety, Work Experience, and Communications. In May 2024, I received my results, and will be awarded my certificate this November:</p>

            <strong>BSc (Hons) in Computer Science (SETU) (2024 - present)</strong>
            <p>I was accepted for a four year Computer Science course with SETU at the Waterford campus, which commenced in September 2024. It is a return to material I am more familiar with, but also includes unfamiliar areas such as Discrete Mathematics.</p>
