				<strong>AfterDawn.com (2004 - 2021)</strong>
				<p>In 2004, at the age of 17, I was hired by Finnish company <a href="https://fin.afterdawn.com" target="_blank">AfterDawn Oy</a>. They had recruited me from their discussion forums, which was a resource for discussion about digital video technology, games consoles, and general tech-related material. At first, my task was to write news for AfterDawn, which were presented as relatively short items that referenced larger news sources.</p>
		
				<p>As time went on, I took on more duties including writing short- and long-form instructional content. These "guides" ranged from tasks as simple as how to play certain types of media files, to opening and repairing damaged Xbox consoles. For a period of time starting in 2008, I served as a "Content Director" at the company, tasked with delegating certain writing tasks to a team of writers, and setting our overall content goals.</p>
		
				<p>Eventually, I left that role and took on further duties, including monitoring Google Analytics data and recommending changes to the website (structural and content) based on that data. The goal was not to just maximize traffic to the site, but to keep people on the site when they visited.</p>
		
				<p>Toward the end of my employment with AfterDawn, I maintained a database of software. This involved finding new Windows applications and adding them to the database, as well as updating the software when new versions were released. We would alert users when the updates made the most important changes, such as security fixes or mitigation for stability issues.</p>
		
				<p>I left AfterDawn in early 2021 after a severely negative impact during the COVID-19 pandemic. After a period of reflection, I decided to <a href="education.html">return to education</a>.</p>

				<strong>Hanley Controls (placement)</strong>
				<p>As part of my Engineering course, I had to spend some time in work placement. This was at <a href="https://www.hccl.ie/" target="_blank">Hanley Controls</a> in Clonmel. While there, I had to carry out many tasks. I cut and measured hydraulic hoses, attached fittings using a crimping machine, applied labels to them, boxed them, etc. I also had to work with pipes for natural gas, using a machine to bend them into standard shapes for use in homes and businesses. In the picture shown, I am using a welding device to weld plastic pipes together.</p>
